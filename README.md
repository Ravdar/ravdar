## Hi, Iâ€™m RafaÅ‚

I have **over 3 years of experience** in improving and automating business processes in **financial institutions**, mostly using **Python** and **VBA**. Lately, Iâ€™ve been interested in **web development**, which has become a personal passion.

If you'd like to see one of my recent projects, feel free to check it out here:  
ðŸŒŽ [**flangu.app**](https://flangu.app/)  
Itâ€™s a fully functional web app for learning vocabulary, used by over **300 users**.  
I built it entirely myself â€” from the **design**, through the **backend** and **frontend**, to deployment.  
The app is built with **Django** and connected to a **PostgreSQL** database. I also created custom Django apps to handle:

- **Stripe** payments  
- **Google authentication**  
- **Automated email verification**  
- **Blog functionality**, and much more.

*The repository is private as this is a production application, but if youâ€™re interested in my earlier open-source work, feel free to scroll down and explore my **pinned repositories**.*
